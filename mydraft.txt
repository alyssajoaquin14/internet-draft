                       draft-habib-voxelvideo-00

Abstract

   This document proposes the VoxelVideo format, a file structure
   designed specifically for the efficient handling, playback, and
   livestreaming of 3D voxel-based videos.  The format is intended for
   applications in gaming, virtual reality, live sports, and interactive
   media, providing a robust framework for managing complex 3D data with
   spatial precision and color fidelity.  This document describes the
   current JSON-based version and outlines future plans to adopt a more
   efficent, compressed format.

Internet-Draft              VoxelVideo Format             September 2024


1.  Introduction

   The VoxelVideo format addresses the need for an efficient and
   scalable method to handle, render, and stream 3D voxel-based videos.
   Existing video formats are not optimized for the distinct
   characteristics of voxel data, such as spatial precision and color
   fidelity in three dimensions.  The VoxelVideo format is tailored for
   use in applications like gaming, virtual reality, live sports, and
   interactive media, where real-time manipulation and playback of
   complex 3D content are essential.  This document describes the JSON-
   based format and outlines future enhancements, including the adoption
   of a compressed binary format aimed at improving performance and
   reducing file sizes.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses the following terms:

   *  *Voxel*: a three-dimensional pixel representing a point in 3D
      space with associated attributes such as color [AES].

   *  *I-frame (Intra-coded frame)*: A self-contained video frame that
      fully represents the voxel grid.

   *  *P-frame (Predicted frame)*: A video frame which contains only
      information on the differences from previous frames.

3.  VoxelVideo Format Overview

   The VoxelVideo format utilizes a JSON-based structure to organize 3D
   voxel data, facilitating efficient playback and manipulation.  It is
   designed to be straightforward to implement, with a focus on clarity
   and accessibility in its initial version.  Future iterations will
   shift towards a compressed binary format to enhance scalability and
   performance.

4.  File Structure and Key Components

   The current structure of the VoxelVideo is as follows:

   export default interface VoxelVideoData {
     Version: number;        // Specifies the version of the file format
     Framerate: number;      // Frames per second
     Framecount: number;     // Total number of frames
     Duration: number;       // Total duration of the video in seconds
     Dimensions: {           // Dimensions of the voxel matrix
       x: number;            // Width in voxels
       y: number;            // Height in voxels
       z: number;            // Depth in voxels
     };
     Title: string;          // Title of the video
     Blocks: (string | null)[][]; // 3D array representing the voxel grid
   }

4.1.  Version

   The Version field ensures compatibility across different iterations
   of the format.

4.2.  Playback Metadata

   Metadata fields like Framerate, Framecount, and Duration provide
   essential information for correct playback of the video content.

4.3.  Voxel Dimensions

   Dimensions defines the size of the voxel space, specifying the width,
   height, and depth necessary for rendering.

4.4.  Title

   The Title field serves to identify the content of the video, for
   easier cataloging and retrieval.

4.5.  Blocks Array

   The Blocks array represents the 3D voxel grid as a nested array,
   where each inner array corresponds to a frame of the video.  Within
   each frame, the arrays represent slices of the voxel space at varying
   depths, providing a structured representation of the 3D voxel data
   across the entire frame.

5.  Frame Types and Future Enhancements

   Currently, the VoxelVideo format utilizes I-frames, where each frame
   is a complete voxel grid independent of other frames.  Future
   versions will include P-frames, which will encode changes between
   frames to reduce file size and improve streaming efficiency in 3D
   environments.

6.  Interpretation of the Blocks Array

   To interpret the Blocks array, read the voxel grid plane by plane,
   starting at the top-left corner of the first plane (height 0),
   proceeding row by row from left to right.  After completing all rows
   of a plane, move up to the next plane and repeat the process until
   all planes are read.

7.  Potential Use Cases

   The VoxelVideo format is suitable for scenarios requiring real-time
   interaction and manipulation of 3D video content.  Use cases include
   immersive virtual reality environments where live 3D voxel video
   streaming can deliver spatially precise and dynamic visual data.  The
   format is also applicable in education simulations that require high-
   fidelity 3D visualizations for teaching concepts in fields such as
   medicine, engineering, and environmental science.  Interactive gaming
   environments can utilize the VoxelVideo format to represent 3D voxel
   data, allowing for the creation of fully manipulable virtual worlds
   that support complex interactions within the game environment.

   In additon, the VoxelVideo format may be used in live sports
   broadcasting to generate 3D replays and visualizations, enabling
   viewers to observe events from various perspectives and analyze the
   content interactively.  This capability can provide additional
   insights beyond traditional 2D video formats.

   The VoxelVideo format supports livestreaming using Dynamic Adaptive
   Streaming over HTTP (DASH), similar to its application for 2D videos.
   This approach allows for efficient and scalable delivery of 3D voxel
   video content across various devices and network conditions by
   segmenting videos into smaller parts and encoding each segment at
   different quality levels.

8.  Future Directions

   The current version of the VoxelVideo format (version 0.0), utilizes
   a JSON-based structure designed for simplicity and ease of use,
   facilitating initial development and experimentation.  Future
   iterations will focus on enhancing performance and scalability by
   transitioning to a compressed binary format, aiming to reduce file
   sizes and improve data storage and retrieval efficiency.
   Additionally, future versions will explore the implementation of
   P-frames to encode changes between frames, further optimizing file
   size and playback performance.  These enhancements are intended to
   expand the format's capabilities, providing a more robust solution
   for managing and delivering 3D voxel-based video content at scale.

9.  Security Considerations

   This document does not specifically address security considerations.
   It is important for implementers of the VoxelVideo format to consider
   the potential security implications associated with processing
   untrusted voxel data.  Implementers should account for the worst-case
   scenarios in terms of computational complexity, memory usage, and
   required processing resources when handling voxel data, especially in
   contexts like livestreaming where inputs may be dynamic and
   unverified.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
